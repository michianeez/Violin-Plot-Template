# Violin-Plot-Template
### Key Information: 

* This project provides a template for a more aesthetically pleasing violin plot with the option of adding  geom_point() displaying a mean/median point and errorbars (for SD or SE). 
* Tested in R Studio Version `4.0.2` and intended for that program, with the use of the ggplot2 and tidyverse packages. 
* There is no dataset provided with the IRL Example code.
   * This is to maintain participant confidentiality. 
   * Hence, if cloned, the code (as it currently is) won't be able to run since the dataframes with the data aren't publically available. 
* All explanatory information is within the .Rmd file; please refer to notes in that file for more clarification. 
* All IRL Examples but the last one can be seen 'in context' by viewing the [data analysis and visualisation code from Lab Report 5](Lab_5_Analysis_and_Viz.Rmd)
